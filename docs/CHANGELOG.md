### **Version 0.6.0 (2025-1-25)**  

#### **New Audio API in `VideoReader`**
#### **Retrieve Audio Data as a Tensor or File**

A new `.audio` property has been added to `VideoReader`, allowing direct access to the `Audio` object:

```python
reader = VideoReader("test.mp4")
if reader.has_audio:
    audio = reader.audio  # Access the audio object
    tensor = audio.tensor()  # Retrieve audio as a PyTorch tensor, 1D. NOTE. THIS HAS BEEN MINIMALLY TESTED
    success = audio.file("output.wav")  # Extract audio to a WAV file
```

#### **Audio Class Features**
- **`tensor()`** â€“ Extracts the audio stream as a PyTorch tensor.
- **`file(output_path)`** â€“ Saves the audio to a specified file path.
- **Read-only Properties:**
  - `sample_rate`: Audio sample rate in Hz.
  - `channels`: Number of audio channels.
  - `bit_depth`: Bit depth of the audio.
  - `codec`: Audio codec format.
  - `bitrate`: Audio bitrate.

Example usage:
```python
print(audio.sample_rate)  # Get the sample rate
print(audio.channels)  # Number of channels
```

### **Version 0.5.8.5 (2025-1-24)**  
- Fixed an issue with ranges being off by 1 frame.

### **Version 0.5.8 (2025-1-24)**  

#### **Improved Property Access for VideoReader**  
- Added direct property access for video metadata.  
- Users can now retrieve video properties directly instead of accessing `properties["key"]`.  
- Example:  
  ```python
  reader = VideoReader("test.mp4")
  print(reader.width)  # Instead of video.properties["width"]
  print(reader.fps)  # Instead of video.properties["fps"]
  ```

- **Available properties:**  
  `width, height, fps, min_fps, max_fps, duration, total_frames, pixel_format, has_audio, audio_bitrate, audio_channels, audio_sample_rate, audio_codec, bit_depth, aspect_ratio, codec`

#### **`__getitem__` Seeking Behavior Update**  
- `__getitem__` now only accepts **seconds (float)** for seeking.  
- Frame-based seeking (int) is currently **not supported** via `__getitem__`.  
- Example usage:  
  ```python
  reader = VideoReader("test.mp4")
  frame = reader[2.5]  # Seeks to 2.5 seconds into the video
  ```


### Version 0.5.7 (2025-1-23)

- **New color format support**  
  Added CPU-based conversions for:
  - 12-bit YUV (420, 422, and 444)
  - 10-bit YUV444
  - ProRes 4444 with alpha (10-bit or 12-bit)
  - Anything NOT 8-bit uses `uint-16` tensors.
  
- **Notes on rawvideo**  
  Raw `.yuv` files still require specifying resolution and pixel format manually.  
  (`-f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -s 1920x1080 â€¦`)  
  - **IN PROGRESS****

- **Other improvements**  
  - Minor cleanups in converter classes.
  - Updated tests to cover the newly supported pixel formats.

### Version 0.5.6.1 (2025-1-23)
  = Adusted `__call__` method handling.
    - `Int` values seek as frames, `Float` values seek as times.
  - Added several tests against `OpenCV` and `FFMPEG` for confirmation on frame/time ranges.
  - Added tests for color formats.

### Version 0.5.6 (2025-1-22)
  = Removed `CUDA` Dependency in favor of CPU decoding. (It's faster anyways.)
  - Updated repo + docs
  - Tested and adjusted time range-- *should* match `OpenCV` behavior in all cases.
  = Looking into color space differences...

### Version 0.5.4 (2024-12-27)
  - Added Support for YUV422P10LE to RGB48 conversion. (CPU)
  - Added Support for GBRP Conversion. (CPU)

  - Adjusted `__call__` and `set_range` methods for `VideoReader`.
    - Now takes `int` for frame steps, `float` for timestamp steps. 
      - Pass int or float and the reader will handle things internally.

  - Some Major Refactoring and changes made.
    - Parsed and created `Filter` classes for every (video) Ffmpeg filter.
      - Filters defined within `Celux.pyi`
        - Not all are tested. For Full documentation of arguments and usage, see: [ffmpeg-filter-docs](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html)
        - Please create a new issue if any problems occur!
    - Fixed an issue with Filter initialization and unwanted output messages. 
    ```py
    from celux import VideoReader, Scale #, CreateFilter, FilterType


    scale_filter = Scale(width = "1920", height = "1080")

    # scale_filter = CreateFilter(FilterType.Scale)
    # scale_filter.setWidth("1920")
    # scale_filter.setHeight"1080")
    # scale_filter.setFlags("bicubic")

    with VideoReader("input.mp4", device = "cpu", filters = [scale_filter]) as reader:
      for frame in reader:
        # will be a scaled frame
    ```

  filters = [("scale", "1280:720"), ("hue", "0.5")]
  reader = cx.VideoReader("/path/to/input", device = "cpu", filters = filters)
  ```

### Version 0.4.4 (2024-10-29)
